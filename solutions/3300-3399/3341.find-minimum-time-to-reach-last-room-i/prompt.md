### Solution 1: Dijkstra's Algorithm

We define a two-dimensional array $\textit{dist}$, where $\textit{dist}[i][j]$ represents the minimum time required to reach room $(i, j)$ from the starting point. Initially, we set all elements in the $\textit{dist}$ array to infinity, and then set the $\textit{dist}$ value of the starting point $(0, 0)$ to $0$.

We use a priority queue $\textit{pq}$ to store each state, where each state consists of three values $(d, i, j)$, representing the time $d$ required to reach room $(i, j)$ from the starting point. Initially, we add the starting point $(0, 0, 0)$ to $\textit{pq}$.

In each iteration, we take the front element $(d, i, j)$ from $\textit{pq}$. If $(i, j)$ is the endpoint, we return $d$. If $d$ is greater than $\textit{dist}[i][j]$, we skip this state. Otherwise, we enumerate the four adjacent positions $(x, y)$ of $(i, j)$. If $(x, y)$ is within the map, we calculate the final time $t$ from $(i, j)$ to $(x, y)$ as $t = \max(\textit{moveTime}[x][y], \textit{dist}[i][j]) + 1$. If $t$ is less than $\textit{dist}[x][y]$, we update the value of $\textit{dist}[x][y]$ and add $(t, x, y)$ to $\textit{pq}$.

The time complexity is $O(n \times m \times \log (n \times m))$, and the space complexity is $O(n \times m)$. Here, $n$ and $m$ are the number of rows and columns of the map, respectively.
