### Solution 1: Memoization Search + Combinatorial Mathematics

First, we count the occurrences of each digit in the string $\textit{num}$ and record them in the array $\textit{cnt}$, then calculate the total sum $\textit{s}$ of the string $\textit{num}$.

If $\textit{s}$ is odd, then $\textit{num}$ cannot be balanced, so we directly return $0$.

Next, we define a memoization search function $\text{dfs}(i, j, a, b)$, where $i$ represents the current digit to be filled, $j$ represents the remaining sum of digits to be filled in odd positions, and $a$ and $b$ represent the remaining number of digits to be filled in odd and even positions, respectively. Let $n$ be the length of the string $\textit{num}$, then the answer is $\text{dfs}(0, s / 2, n / 2, (n + 1) / 2)$.

In the function $\text{dfs}(i, j, a, b)$, we first check if all digits have been filled. If so, we need to ensure that $j = 0$, $a = 0$, and $b = 0$. If these conditions are met, it means the current arrangement is balanced, so we return $1$; otherwise, we return $0$.

Next, we check if the remaining number of digits to be filled in odd positions $a$ is $0$ and $j > 0$. If so, it means the current arrangement is not balanced, so we return $0$ early.

Otherwise, we can enumerate the number of current digits assigned to odd positions $l$, and the number of digits assigned to even positions is $r = \textit{cnt}[i] - l$. We need to ensure $0 \leq r \leq b$ and $l \times i \leq j$. Then we calculate the number of current arrangements $t = C_a^l \times C_b^r \times \text{dfs}(i + 1, j - l \times i, a - l, b - r)$. Finally, the answer is the sum of all arrangement counts.

The time complexity is $O(|\Sigma| \times n^2 \times (n + |\Sigma|))$, where $|\Sigma|$ represents the number of different digits, and in this problem $|\Sigma| = 10$. The space complexity is $O(n^2 \times |\Sigma|^2)$.
