### Solution 1: Simulation

We can use an array $\textit{word}$ to store the string after each operation. When the length of $\textit{word}$ is less than $k$, we continuously perform operations on $\textit{word}$.

Finally, return $\textit{word}[k - 1]$.

The time complexity is $O(k)$, and the space complexity is $O(k)$. Here, $k$ is the input parameter.
