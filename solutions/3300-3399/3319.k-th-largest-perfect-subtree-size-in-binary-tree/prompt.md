### Solution 1: DFS + Sorting

We define a function $\textit{dfs}$ to calculate the size of the perfect binary subtree rooted at the current node, using an array $\textit{nums}$ to record the sizes of all perfect binary subtrees. If the subtree rooted at the current node is not a perfect binary subtree, it returns $-1$.

The execution process of the function $\textit{dfs}$ is as follows:

1. If the current node is null, return $0$;
2. Recursively calculate the sizes of the perfect binary subtrees of the left and right subtrees, denoted as $l$ and $r$ respectively;
3. If the sizes of the left and right subtrees are not equal, or if the sizes of the left and right subtrees are less than $0$, return $-1$;
4. Calculate the size of the perfect binary subtree rooted at the current node $\textit{cnt} = l + r + 1$, and add $\textit{cnt}$ to the array $\textit{nums}$;
5. Return $\textit{cnt}$.

We call the $\textit{dfs}$ function to calculate the sizes of all perfect binary subtrees. If the length of the array $\textit{nums}$ is less than $k$, return $-1$. Otherwise, sort the array $\textit{nums}$ in descending order and return the $k$-th largest perfect binary subtree size.

The time complexity is $O(n \times \log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
