### Solution 1: DFS + String Hashing

We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and compute the entire $\textit{dfsStr}$, while also determining the interval $[l, r]$ for each node.

Then, we use string hashing to compute the hash values of both $\textit{dfsStr}$ and the reverse of $\textit{dfsStr}$ to check if it is a palindrome.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the length of the string $s$.
