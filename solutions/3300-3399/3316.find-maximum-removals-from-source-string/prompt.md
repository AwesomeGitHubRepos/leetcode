### Solution 1: Dynamic Programming

We define $f[i][j]$ to represent the maximum number of deletions in the first $i$ characters of $\textit{source}$ that match the first $j$ characters of $\textit{pattern}$. Initially, $f[0][0] = 0$, and the rest $f[i][j] = -\infty$.

For $f[i][j]$, we have two choices:

-   We can skip the $i$-th character of $\textit{source}$, in which case $f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] + \text{int}(i-1 \in \textit{targetIndices})$;
-   If $\textit{source}[i-1] = \textit{pattern}[j-1]$, we can match the $i$-th character of $\textit{source}$, in which case $f[i][j] = \max(f[i][j], f[i-1][j-1])$.

The final answer is $f[m][n]$.

The time complexity is $O(m \times n)$, and the space complexity is $O(m \times n)$. Here, $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of $\textit{source}$ and $\textit{pattern}$, respectively.
