### Solution 1: Recurrence

Since the length of the string doubles after each operation, if we perform $i$ operations, the length of the string will be $2^i$.

We can simulate this process to find the first string length $n$ that is greater than or equal to $k$.

Next, we backtrack and discuss the following cases:

-   If $k \gt n / 2$, it means $k$ is in the second half. If $\textit{operations}[i - 1] = 1$, it means the character at position $k$ is obtained by adding $1$ to the character in the first half. We add $1$ to it. Then we update $k$ to $k - n / 2$.
-   If $k \le n / 2$, it means $k$ is in the first half and is not affected by $\textit{operations}[i - 1]$.
-   Next, we update $n$ to $n / 2$ and continue backtracking until $n = 1$.

Finally, we take the resulting number modulo $26$ and add the ASCII code of `'a'` to get the answer.

The time complexity is $O(\log k)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.
