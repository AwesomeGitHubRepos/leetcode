### Solution 1: Two DFS

We can start from $k$ and find all suspicious methods, recording them in the array $\textit{suspicious}$. Then, we traverse from $0$ to $n-1$, starting from all non-suspicious methods, and mark all reachable methods as non-suspicious. Finally, we return all non-suspicious methods.

The time complexity is $O(n + m)$, and the space complexity is $O(n + m)$. Here, $n$ and $m$ represent the number of methods and the number of call relationships, respectively.
