### Solution 1: Enumeration

We note that within every $10$ numbers, there will definitely be an integer whose digit product is $0$. Therefore, we can directly enumerate integers greater than or equal to $n$ until we find an integer whose digit product is divisible by $t$.

The time complexity is $O(\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$.
