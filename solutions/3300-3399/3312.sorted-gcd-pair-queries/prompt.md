### Solution 1: Preprocessing + Prefix Sum + Binary Search

We can preprocess to obtain the occurrence count of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all pairs in the array $\textit{nums}$, recorded in the array $\textit{cntG}$. Then, we calculate the prefix sum of the array $\textit{cntG}$. Finally, for each query, we can use binary search to find the index of the first element in the array $\textit{cntG}$ that is greater than $\textit{queries}[i]$, which is the answer.

Let $\textit{mx}$ denote the maximum value in the array $\textit{nums}$, and let $\textit{cnt}$ record the occurrence count of each number in the array $\textit{nums}$. Let $\textit{cntG}[i]$ denote the number of pairs in the array $\textit{nums}$ whose GCD is equal to $i$. To calculate $\textit{cntG}[i]$, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the occurrence count $v$ of multiples of $i$ in the array $\textit{nums}$. Then, the number of pairs formed by any two elements from these multiples must have a GCD that is a multiple of $i$, i.e., $\textit{cntG}[i]$ needs to be increased by $v \times (v - 1) / 2$;
2. We need to exclude pairs whose GCD is a multiple of $i$ and greater than $i$. Therefore, for multiples $j$ of $i$, we need to subtract $\textit{cntG}[j]$.

The above steps require us to traverse $i$ from large to small so that when calculating $\textit{cntG}[i]$, we have already calculated all $\textit{cntG}[j]$.

Finally, we calculate the prefix sum of the array $\textit{cntG}$, and for each query, we can use binary search to find the index of the first element in the array $\textit{cntG}$ that is greater than $\textit{queries}[i]$, which is the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n + (M + q) \times \log M)$, and the space complexity is $O(M)$. Here, $n$ and $M$ represent the length and the maximum value of the array $\textit{nums}$, respectively, and $q$ represents the number of queries.
