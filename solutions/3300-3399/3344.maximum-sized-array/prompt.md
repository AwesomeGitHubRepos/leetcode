### Solution 1: Preprocessing + Binary Search

We can roughly estimate the maximum value of $n$. For $j \lor k$, the sum of the results is approximately $n^2 (n - 1) / 2$. Multiplying this by each $i \in [0, n)$, the result is approximately $(n-1)^5 / 4$. To ensure $(n - 1)^5 / 4 \leq s$, we have $n \leq 1320$.

Therefore, we can preprocess $f[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{i} (i \lor j)$, and then use binary search to find the largest $n$ such that $f[n-1] \cdot (n-1) \cdot n / 2 \leq s$.

In terms of time complexity, the preprocessing has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, and the binary search has a time complexity of $O(\log n)$. Therefore, the total time complexity is $O(n^2 + \log n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$.
